# ReactRuboku
An implementation of the Android game Ruboku, written in React.

The main purpose of this project is just to learn some of the basic functionality of React with a game I'd previously written in Java for Android.

To run:
* In the "ruboku" folder, type "npm start". The app will then be viewable in the browser at http://localhost:3000/
